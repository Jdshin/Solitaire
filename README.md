# How to play
The goal of Solitaire is to move all cards into the four scoring piles.
Click on the draw pile to reveal a faceup card to use for rearranging cards
Clicking on an empty draw pile will place the discard pile back into the draw pile.
Kings can be placed onto empty piles.
Score piles accept cards in ascending order, starting from Ace. 
Facedown cards in rearranging piles will be flipped faceup if there are no other cards on top of it.

# Card Placement Rules
Cards can only be placed on top of another card if the card below is an opposite suit and one value higher than the card to be placed. 

# Card Movement Rules
Cards can only be moved when faceup. If there are cards on top of the card to be moved, all cards must be placed with descending values and alternating color suits.
